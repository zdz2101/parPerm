Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    This package is to demonstrate the using of parallel processing to perform permutations tests of neuroimaging data. 
    Included in this package, will contain functions that prepare your data for the parallel processing pipeline, both your predictor variable matrix, and outcome variable matrix (the neuroimaging data).
    Users may choose to run analysis for image data containing masks or not.
